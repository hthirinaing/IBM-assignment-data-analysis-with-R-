This project relates to the NOAA Weather Dataset - JFK Airport (New York). The original dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of 12 local climatological variables (such as temperature and wind speed) collected at JFK airport. This dataset can be obtained for free from the IBM Developer Data Asset Exchange.
The end goal is to predict the precipitation using some of the available features. This includes creating models, improving models and evaluating them to ultimately choose the best model.
